            The wolf  also known as<strong> the  gray wolf </strong> or <strong> grey wolf </strong> , is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America.</br>
             More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog and dingo, though gray wolves, as popularly understood, only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies.</br>
             The wolf is the largest extant member of <strong> the family Canidae </strong>, and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, 
             as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail.</br>
             The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them.</br>
             The wolf's fur is usually mottled<strong> white, brown, gray, and black </strong>, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.</br>

            Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes,also known as the simians.</br>
            Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes.</br>
            which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics.</br>
            apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.

            The<strong>cat (Felis catus)</strong> , commonly referred to as the <strong>domestic cat</strong> or <strong> house cat </strong>, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.</br>
             Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the <strong> Near East around 7500 BC </strong>.</br>
             It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.</br>
             It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats.</br>
             It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.</br>
             It is a <strong>social species </strong>, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.</br>
             Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language.</br>
              It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals.</br>
             It also secretes and perceives pheromones.
